Codility SherWeb tasks:
1. FormatStringPhone: Return a formated number phone in blocks of length three, except if number has length 10: ###-###-##-##. It contains at least two digits.
2. NumberIndenticalPairsIndice: Given an Array A of N integers, returns the number of identical pairs of indices.
3. DeepNestedJS: Given a DOM tree, returns the maximum depth of nested `<ul>` or `<ol>` lists.

Codelity lessons:
1. FindBiggestBinaryGap: Given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
2. SmallEstInteger: Given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A. For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
